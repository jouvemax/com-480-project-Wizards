# Milestone 1

What do you know about Co2 emissions?

A project to learn about Co2 emissions to understand the challenges we are facing with climate change. 

## Dataset

We would like to build an interactive website, where the user can first understand where he/her is standing regarding emissions.
We will then test the user with short quizzes about Co2 emissions facts, and finally showing the real facts, in a easily understandable way.

Thus, we will have a top-down approach:

- First showing global emissions per sectors and countries. This will allow the user to see which countries and sectors are responsible for the emissions. We
will be using [Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Country and Economic Sector](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/cli008-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-by-Country-and-Sector-Full-Longform?hash=layers&section=Discover&zoom=1&lat=0&lng=0&pitch=0&bearing=0&basemap=dark&labels=light&layers=%255B%257B%2522dataset%2522%253A%2522a290675c-9528-4a51-8201-f6c2d7848744%2522%252C%2522opacity%2522%253A1%252C%2522layer%2522%253A%2522c0c8ee6e-5cd4-4c9d-bd10-ce6545b26fef%2522%257D%255D&page=1&sort=most-viewed&sortDirection=-1) data, that was itself obtained from this ClimateWatch [dataset](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/data-explorer/historical-emissions?historical-emissions-data-sources=71&historical-emissions-gases=246&historical-emissions-regions=All%20Selected&historical-emissions-sectors=843&page=3#data).
It corresponds to historical data ranging from 1990 until 2017 of emissions per countries and sector. We will focus on the most recent data (2017) and ....
The raw data is available here.
focus on Co2 and few sectors....


## Problematic

The goal of our project is to offer a better understanding of Co2 emissions. Indeed, tackling the climate change problem has become a priority, and the young 
generation is taking actions through activism, entrepreneurship or in politics. 
However, it is still important to educate people about emissions. We need to understand where there are coming from, and what can we do to reduce them.
