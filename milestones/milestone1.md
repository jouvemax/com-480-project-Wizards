# Milestone 1

What do you know about Co2 emissions?

A project to learn about Co2 emissions to understand the challenges we are facing with climate change. 

## Dataset

We will use multiple datasets for each part of our visualization:

- First showing global emissions per sectors and countries. This will allow the user to see which countries and sectors are responsible for the emissions. We
will be using [Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Country and Economic Sector](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/cli008-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-by-Country-and-Sector-Full-Longform?hash=layers&section=Discover&zoom=1&lat=0&lng=0&pitch=0&bearing=0&basemap=dark&labels=light&layers=%255B%257B%2522dataset%2522%253A%2522a290675c-9528-4a51-8201-f6c2d7848744%2522%252C%2522opacity%2522%253A1%252C%2522layer%2522%253A%2522c0c8ee6e-5cd4-4c9d-bd10-ce6545b26fef%2522%257D%255D&page=1&sort=most-viewed&sortDirection=-1) data, that was itself obtained from this ClimateWatch [dataset](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/data-explorer/historical-emissions?historical-emissions-data-sources=71&historical-emissions-gases=246&historical-emissions-regions=All%20Selected&historical-emissions-sectors=843&page=3#data).
The raw data can be seen [here]().
It corresponds to historical data ranging from 1990 until 2017 of emissions per countries and sector. We will focus on the most recent data (2017).
We have decided to mix some sectors together to keep the data visualization easier. We will focus on the 4 following sectors: Energy (electricity production), Industry, Transport and Agriculture. We are using the MtCo2e metric (Million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent), which means that we consider the green house gases altogether and do not make distinctions betweens carbon dioxyd and methan for example.

## Problematic

The goal of our project is to offer a better understanding of Co2 emissions. Indeed, tackling the climate change problem has become a priority, and the young 
generation is taking actions through activism, entrepreneurship or in politics. 
However, it is still important to educate people about emissions. We need to understand where there are coming from, and what can we do to reduce them.

## Related work

• What others have already done with the data?
There are various websites that offer visualization of data related to Co2 emissions. However, usually they do not provide context about emissions, their analysis is either only global (countries and sector) or only focus on one sector. 

• Why is your approach original?
We would like to give a top down approach of Co2 emissions. The user will first see how he compare with people living in other countries in term of emissions. He will then have an overview of emissions, by looking at countries on a map and sectors. Finally we would like to give him insights of each sector taken independently. Where are the agriculture emissions from? Why does the industry is such a big polluter etc... What kind of solutions already exist for each sectors, and what are the ones that still need to be developped.

We hope that by the end of our visualization, the user will have a better understanding of Co2 emissions and, thus, can have a better impact.
