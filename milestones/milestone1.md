# Milestone 1

What do you know about Co2 emissions?

A project to learn about Co2 emissions to understand the challenges we are facing with climate change. 

## Dataset

We would like to build an interactive website, where the user can first understand where he/her is standing regarding emissions.
We will then test the user with short quizzes about Co2 emissions facts, and finally showing the real facts, in a easily understandable way.

Thus, we will have a top-down approach:

- First showing global emissions per sectors and countries. 


## Problematic

The goal of our project is to offer a better understanding of Co2 emissions. Indeed, tackling the climate change problem has become a priority, and the young 
generation is taking actions through activism, entrepreneurship or in politics. 
However, it is still important to educate people about emissions. We need to understand where there are coming from, and what can we do to reduce them.
